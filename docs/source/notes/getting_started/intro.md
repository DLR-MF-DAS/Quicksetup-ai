# What is this template?

MLPT is a combination of [pyscaffold datascience](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffoldext-dsproject) and [lightning-hydra](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template). It provides a general baseline for Deep Learning projects including:
* A predefined structure which simplifies the development of the project.
* A set of tools for experiment tracking, hyper parameter search and rapid experimentation using configuration files. More details in [lightning-hydra](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).
* Pre-commit hooks and automatic documentation generation.
